# demo-shop-css

# educational HTML-CSS project 

This project is almost completely scratched out from https://github.com/scizor666/demo-shop

To compile css from scss using in-built utils you must have the following tools installed:
* ruby 
* sass gem  

the command ./bin/sass2css from the project root wil do the trick.

## Tested on Mac OS 10.12.6 ( compatibility with other OS is not guaranteed)
